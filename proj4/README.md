The point of this project was to get familiar with writing a big more indepth pageserver that works with AJAX, Flask, HTML/CSS, Docker, and python.

This projet we were to make a version of the Brevet Calculator implementing AJAX into it.
The original calculator was this one right here. (https://rusa.org/octime_acp.html)

We were able to use flask to make the server, AJAX/HTML/CSS to really help update the server, and we used our acp_times.py to help withe logic behind the calcuator. I was also able to use nosetests to help change make sure that my logic was working. If you want to tests go into the test directory and use the command "nosetests test_acp_times_checker.py"
